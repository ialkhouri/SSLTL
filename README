This repo is for the 2022 AAMAS paper "Controller Synthesis for Omega-Regular and Steady-State Specifications". 

For setup, please follow the below instructions. 

SETUP
=====
1) Setup Anaconda environment. Run these commands (assumes Anaconda is already installed):
conda create -n SSLTL
conda activate SSLTL
pip install tarjan

2) Install rabinizer 4 (to get the ltl2dra tool) from here: https://www7.in.tum.de/~kretinsk/rabinizer4.html
   I put it in ~/rabinizer4 (~ represents my home folder).
   Update the "ltl2drafolder" variable int the scripts to point at the bin folder. (/home/user/rabinizer4/bin)
   Also Rabinizer verfiied is available, but I did not try it: https://www7.in.tum.de/~sickert/projects/rabinizer_verfied/

3) Install CPLEX. I used version 12.10.  Students can get the full version free: https://content-eu-7.content-cms.com/b73a5759-c6a6-4033-ab6b-d9d4f9a6d65b/dxsites/151914d1-03d2-48fe-97d9-d21166848e65/academic/home
   I installed in the folder ~/CPLEX_Studio1210

4) Setup CPLEX's Python
   See https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_12.7.1/ilog.odms.cplex.help/CPLEX/GettingStarted/topics/set_up/Python_setup.html
   I ran these commands:
       conda activate SSLTL
       cd ~/CPLEX_Studio1210/cplex/python/3.7/x86-64_linux
       python setup.py install

5) Install SPOT: https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/install.html. This is tricky, since it must be compiled.
   I used these commands, which installs SPOT inside ~/usr:
        ./configure --prefix ~/usr
        make
        make install

6) Install DOT. On Ubuntu, you can run this command:
   sudo apt-get install graphviz


 Notes: Since SPOT and DOT are only used for visualizing the MDP, they are not absolutely necessary.
        If you don't install them, you cannot use the SSLTLplot library.
